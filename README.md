# Test creation concept

Tests are written using the Page Object Model.
Page Object is a Design Pattern that has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don't need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change.

## Running tests locally

Before starting you have to choose address and browser in maven profiles.
* address.xxx - test run environment
* browser.xxx - browser to run tests

* run tests by maven for example with browser chrome and address called 'first' - mvn clean test -P browser.chrome,address.first
* run by maven with specific xml file - mvn clean test -P browser.chrome,address.first -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=src/main/resources/testing.xml
* tests can also be run using testing.xml and specific test class (right click on the file in Intellij and left click Run xxx)

## Structure of example testing.xml
````
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name="Suite">
    <listeners>
        <listener class-name="pages.TestListener"/>
    </listeners>
    <test name="Test">
        <classes>
            <class name="tests.example.ExampleTest"/>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
````

## Reports

Reports after tests are generated by Extent Reports framework in 'target' directory (for example filename TestReport_2025-01-02_10-51-51.html)
